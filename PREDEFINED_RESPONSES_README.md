# Predefined Responses System

## Overview

The LinkedIn Future Career Planning Platform now includes a sophisticated predefined responses system that provides personalized, personality-aware answers to common career planning questions. This system is designed to work seamlessly with the existing chat functionality while providing highly contextual and personalized responses.

## Key Features

### üéØ **Personality-Aware Responses**

- **Contextual Personalization**: Answers are tailored based on Technology/Leadership interests, remote work preferences, and advancement goals
- **LinkedIn Integration**: All recommendations include direct links to LinkedIn resources

### üîç **Smart Question Matching**
The system recognizes variations of the four main career planning questions:

1. **Career Advancement**: "How can I advance from Senior Developer to Tech Lead?"
2. **Director Skills**: "What skills do I need for a Director position?"
3. **Remote Jobs**: "Show me remote job opportunities in tech"
4. **Leadership Workshops**: "What workshops are available for leadership skills?"

### üé® **Default Preferences Detection**
- Automatically detects when users have default settings
- Provides enhanced responses for users with default preferences
- Falls back to general responses for customized preferences
